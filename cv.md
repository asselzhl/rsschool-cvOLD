## About me
It's been only 6 month since I've started learning Web development by myself. Despite such a short time, I have a good command of HTML and CSS. Moreover, recently I've started exploring JavaScript and I'm already familiar with the basic concepts of this language as well as solving 6-7 kyu katas at Codewars. 
I understand that learning Web development is a lot of work, so I will achieve this goal thanks to my strengths like: 
1. Responsibility;
2. Discipline;
3. Focus.

## Skills 
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript 
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code
## Code Example 

**Task:**

You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value.
Array can contain numbers or strings. X can be either.
Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.

**Solution:**
```
const check = (a, x) => {
  let i = 0;
  while (i < a.length) {
    if (a[i] == x) {
      return true;
    }
    i = i + 1;
  }
  return false;
}
```
